# Google Certified Professional Data Engineer

## Storage and Databases

- Cloud storage
- Data transfer services
- Cloud SQL 
- Cloud Firestore
- Cloud Spanner
- Cloud Memorystore


## Big Data Ecosystem

- MapReduce
- Hadoop
- __Apache Pig :__
  - Platform for analysing large datasets
  - Language : Pig Latin
  - Abstaction for Map Reduce
  - Useful for creating ETL
  - Pig is a high level framework for running MapReduce jobs on __Hadoop__ clusters
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka


## Real Time Messaging with Pub/Sub

- Global messaging and event ingestion 
- Serveless
- 500 millions of messages per seconds
- "At least one delivery" guaranty
- Two types of subscription :
  - __Pull__ : default, messages must be acknowledged 
  - __Push__ : sent messages to an endpoint (HTTPS)
- Message retention default duration : 7 days (min : 10 min / max : 7 days)
- Messages must be 10Mb or less size


## Pipelines with Cloud Dataflow

- Powerfull ETL tool for transforming and enriching data
- Fully managed, serveless
- Uses open source Apache [Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) SDK
- Supports SQL, Java, Python
- Real-time and batch processing
- Stackdriver integration
- Data Source (Storage, BigQuery, PubSub, Kafka) -> Pipepline (Dataflow) -> Data Sink (Storage, BigQuery, Bigtable)
- Pipelines are DAGS
- A PCollection is a data set or data stream. The data that a pipeline processes is part of a PCollection
- Window - A PCollection can be subdivided into windows based on the timestamps of the individual elements. Windows enable grouping operations over collections that grow over time by dividing the collection into windows of finite collections.
- Watermark - A watermark is a guess as to when all data in a certain window is expected to have arrived. This is needed because data isnâ€™t always guaranteed to arrive in a pipeline in time order, or to always arrive at predictable intervals.
- Trigger - A trigger determines when to aggregate the results of each window. For bounded data, results are emitted after all of the input has been processed. For unbounded data, results are emitted when the watermark passes the end of the window, indicating that the system believes all input data for that window has been processed.
